# CocaCola Stock Price Prediction

This project applies multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM, to predict CocaCola's stock price movements.

Project Outline

Data Preparation: Collected historical stock data, computed technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD), market indicators, stock data of competitors.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations, correlation analysis, feature selection.

Models Implemented:

Linear Regression with Cross-validation

Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning

LSTM model with hyperparameter optimization 

Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
